In this post, I want to share my experience building this portfolio website using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that allows me to write content in Markdown and automatically converts it to a complete website. I chose Jekyll for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity** - Jekyll has a straightforward structure
2. **Markdown support** - Writing content in Markdown is efficient and easy
3. **GitHub Pages integration** - Jekyll works seamlessly with GitHub Pages
4. **Free hosting** - GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll sites
5. **Version control** - All content is under Git version control

## The Development Process

The development process involved several steps:

1. Setting up the Jekyll framework
2. Creating custom layouts and includes
3. Designing the site with CSS and responsive elements
4. Writing the initial content
5. Deploying to GitHub Pages

## Lessons Learned

Building this site taught me several valuable lessons:

- The importance of mobile-first design
- How to structure content for better readability
- Techniques for optimizing a static site for performance
- How to organize a project using Jekyll's conventions

## Next Steps

I plan to continue improving this site by:

- Adding more projects to the portfolio section
- Implementing category pages for better content organization
- Enhancing the design with animations and interactive elements
- Adding a contact form for easier communication
